Refactoring the CSS to avoid `!important` involves understanding the specificity of CSS selectors and restructuring styles for clarity and predictability.

Here's a solution that addresses the issue without using `!important`:

```css
#myElement {
  width: 200px;
}

.anotherClass #myElement {
  width: 300px; /* No more !important */
}

/* Or, for more control, add a more specific class */
.anotherClass .myElementClass {
  width: 300px;
}
```

By adjusting the selectors or using a more specific class, we achieve the same styling outcome without compromising the predictability and maintainability of the CSS.
